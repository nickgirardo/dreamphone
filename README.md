# Dream Phone

This hack is based off a board game from the 90s called Dream Phone. Imagine Clue, but instead of a murder mystery, it's the more dramatic issue of figuring out your secret admirer!

This project was built with the Twilio API and Python.

## Instructions
#### Printing out the materials
Follow this link to the [materials](https://github.com/nickgirardo/dreamphone/tree/master/assets/print). Then simply down them out print them out! (Plus, you can carry pictures of your Dream Boy (or Boys!) wherever you go.)
#### Running the game 
There are basically three steps to getting this game up and running:
1. Buying twelve phone numbers from Twilio.
2. Set them all in the same TwiML app. For our project, this is done in [app.py](https://github.com/nickgirardo/dreamphone/tree/master/assets/print), so feel free to replace the numbers in that code.
3. Run the app using whatever server you choose.

Call any of the numbers you've bought, and that game session will start with an introduction.
It's important to know that each phone you use to call the TwiML app with holds a unique game session from start to finish. If playing with friends, be sure to use the same phone.
